# Medical diagnosis Web Application

## Overview

The aim of this application is to provide a precise diagnosis that strengthens any doctorâ€™sknowledge. The misdiagnosis of diabetes insipidus and related diseases is very common and can lead to serious effects that can  put the patient in a coma.

I created this web application in Django and I am using a ML model based on decision rules of polyuria, hypotonic urine, thirst, serum osmolality and serum sodium. Once the patient's data is introduced, the user can simply see the predicted diagnosis or he can choose to visualize the result in a decision tree that is dinamically built. Then the data is saved in a database where the doctor can see all his patients. From the UI the doctor can also add, edit, delete, archive a patient and approve of the diagnosis. When the diagnosis is approved or a patient is archived, the certain data is then used to improve the accuracy of the predictions.
